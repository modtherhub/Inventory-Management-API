## Feature 3: Inventory Levels API

The **Inventory Levels API** provides authenticated users with an endpoint to monitor and filter their inventory items efficiently. Each user only has access to their own items.

### ðŸ”¹ Endpoint

* `GET /api/inventory-levels/` â†’ Returns the authenticated userâ€™s inventory with quantities and details.

### ðŸ”¹ Filtering Options

#### 1. **Category Filter**

Retrieve items belonging to a specific category.

```bash
GET /api/inventory-levels/?category=electronics
```

#### 2. **Price Range Filter**

Filter items within a price range using `min_price` and `max_price`.

```bash
GET /api/inventory-levels/?min_price=100&max_price=500
```

#### 3. **Low Stock Filter**

Identify items with low stock using `low_stock`.

* Default threshold: `5` (if no value is provided).
* Custom threshold: pass a number (e.g., `?low_stock=10`).

```bash
# Default low stock (â‰¤ 5)
GET /api/inventory-levels/?low_stock=true  

# Custom threshold (â‰¤ 10)
GET /api/inventory-levels/?low_stock=10
```
